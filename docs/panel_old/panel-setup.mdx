# Panel Setup

The core environment is easily configured using a single CLI command & the web installer built into the app.
These steps will cover setting up things such as sessions, caching, database credentials, and email sending.

Running `php artisan p:environment:setup` will, if it does not exist, auto create the required `.env` file and generate a `APP_KEY`.

```sh
php artisan p:environment:setup
```

<Admonition type="warning" title="BACK UP APP_KEY!">
    **Back up** your encryption key (APP_KEY in the `.env` file). This is used as an encryption key for all data that needs to be stored securely (e.g. api keys).
    Store it somewhere safe - not just on your server. If you lose it all encrypted data is irrecoverable -- **even if you have database backups.**

### Setting Permissions

The next step in the installation process is to set the correct permissions on the Panel files so that the webserver can
use them correctly.

```sh
sudo chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache/
```

<Tabs groupId="webserver">
    <TabItem value='NGINX/Apache/Caddy'>
        ```sh
        sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/pelican
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='Rocky Linux NGINX'>
        ```sh
        sudo chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/pelican
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value='Rocky Linux Apache'>
        ```sh
        sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/pelican
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Web-Installer

Once you've set the proper permissions, continue the Panel install on the web interface.
The web installer is located at `<domain>/installer` or `<ip>/installer`.
