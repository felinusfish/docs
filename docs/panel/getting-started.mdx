# Getting Started

:::warning[Standalone Installations]
As of **[WRITE DATE HERE]**, installing the panel via Docker is now the preferred installation method.

Standalone installations will continue to be supported, but users are highly recommended to switch to Docker.
A migration guide can be found [here](/docs/guides/docker).
:::

The panel is designed to be run on a **dedicated Linux server**.
This documentation is intended for beginners who understand Linux basics.

Running it on unsupported hardware or operating systems may cause unwanted side-effects.

### Prerequisites

Pelican runs on a wide range of operating systems, so pick whichever you are most comfortable using.
Please ensure that the operating system you are using supports [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/).
