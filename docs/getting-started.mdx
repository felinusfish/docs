# Getting Started

:::warning[Standalone Installations]
As of **[date of merge / announcement]**, installing the panel via **Docker** is now the preferred installation method.

Standalone installations will continue to be supported, but users are highly recommended to switch to Docker.
A migration guide can be found [here](/docs/guides/docker).

The panel is designed to be run on a **dedicated Linux server**. We do not 
This documentation is intended for beginners who understand Linux basics.

Running it on unsupported hardware or operating systems may cause unwanted side-effects.

### Prerequisites

Pelican runs on a wide range of operating systems, so pick whichever you are most comfortable using.
Please ensure that the operating system you are using supports [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/).

When trying to run under `Virtuozzo`, `OpenVZ` / `OVZ`, or `LXC` virtualization, you may experience issues running Docker containers.
Some providers have made the necessary changes for nested virtualization to support Docker.
Typically, `kvm` and `none` are guaranteed to run Docker without an issue.

:::info
If your system is running systemd, the easiest way to check is to run `systemd-detect-virt` on your system.
Otherwise, you can also run this command:
```sh
sudo dmidecode -s system-manufacturer
```

### Installing Docker  {#docker-install}

For a quick install of Docker CE, you can use the command below:
```sh
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | CHANNEL=stable sudo sh
```

### Enabling Docker on System Boot {#docker-on-boot}

Most modern Linux operating system support systemd (Ubuntu 16+, Debian 8+, CentOS 7+).
You should therefore have the ability to run the command below to have Docker start when you boot your machine.
```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

### Enabling Swap on Docker {#docker-swap}

On most systems, Docker will be unable to setup swap space by default. You can confirm this by running `docker info` and looking for the output of `WARNING: No swap limit support` near the bottom.

Enabling swap is entirely optional, but we recommended doing it if you will be hosting for others and to prevent OOM errors.

To enable swap, open `/etc/default/grub` as a root user and find the line starting with `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`. Make
sure the line includes `swapaccount=1` somewhere inside the double-quotes.

After that, run `sudo update-grub` followed by `sudo reboot` to restart the server and have swap enabled.
Below is an example of what the line should look like, _do not copy this line verbatim. It often has additional OS-specific parameters._

```text
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="swapaccount=1"
```

<Admonition type="info" title="GRUB Configurations">
    Some Linux distros may ignore `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`.  
    Therefore you might have to use `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` instead should the above variable not work for you.
