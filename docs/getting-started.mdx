# Getting Started

<!-- CHANGE BEFORE MERGING! DATE NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED TO CORRECT DATE! -->
:::warning[Standalone Installations]
As of **[date of merge / announcement]**, installing the panel via **Docker** is now the preferred installation method.

Standalone installations will continue to be supported, but users are highly recommended to switch to Docker.
A migration guide can be found [here](/docs/guides/docker).
:::

The panel is designed to be run on a **dedicated Linux server**. We do not 
This documentation is intended for beginners who understand Linux basics.

Running it on unsupported hardware or operating systems may cause unwanted side-effects.

### Prerequisites

Pelican runs on a wide range of operating systems, so pick whichever you are most comfortable using.
Please ensure that the operating system you are using supports [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/).

When trying to run under `Virtuozzo`, `OpenVZ` / `OVZ`, or `LXC` virtualization, you may experience issues running Docker containers.
Some providers have made the necessary changes for nested virtualization to support Docker.
Typically, `kvm` and `none` are guaranteed to run Docker without an issue.

:::info[Checking Virtualization]
If your system is running systemd, the easiest way to check is to run `systemd-detect-virt` on your system.
Otherwise, you may also be able to run this command:
```sh
sudo dmidecode -s system-manufacturer
```

### Installing Docker  {#docker-install}

For a quick install of Docker CE, you can run the command below, which will automatically install it on most Linux systems.
```sh
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | CHANNEL=stable sudo sh
```

### Enabling Docker on System Boot {#docker-on-boot}

Most modern Linux operating system support systemd (Ubuntu 16+, Debian 8+, CentOS 7+).
You should therefore have the ability to run the command below to have Docker start when you boot your machine.
```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

### Enabling Swap on Docker {#docker-swap}
On most systems, Docker will be unable to setup swap space by default. 
Enabling swap is entirely optional, but highly recommended when hosting for others, or running large servers to prevent OOM (out-of-memory) errors.
You can confirm this by running `docker info`. If you find `WARNING: No swap limit support`, your Docker setup won't be able to support swap files.

:::info[If you can't run commands...]
On most versions of Ubuntu, `sudo` is provided for you, which allows you to run commands with elevated privileges.
To understand if a command needs elevated privileges, it will typically describe **Authentication Required** or **Permission Denied** errors.

You can also use `sudo su` to run commands as the root user with elevated privileges, and `exit` to return to an unprivileged user.
:::

To enable **swap**, open `/etc/default/grub` with your command-line text editor of choice (**nano** or **vim**) as the root user,
and find `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`. You'll want to then add `swapaccount=1` to the parameters, between the quotation marks, like so:
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="swapaccount=1"
```
Make sure the line includes `swapaccount=1` somewhere inside the double-quotes.

After that, run `update-grub` followed by `reboot` to restart the server and have swap enabled.
Below is an example of what the line should look like, _do not copy this line verbatim. It often has additional OS-specific parameters._


:::info[GRUB Configuration]
    In rare cases, `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` may not work.
    You may be required to use `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` instead.
