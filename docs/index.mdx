# Introduction

### What is [Pelican](https://github.com/pelican-dev/panel)?

**Pelican** is a generic server management panel, designed for hosting and managing isolated Docker containers containing game servers, software and applications.
It is a heavily modified fork of [**Pterodactyl**](https://pterodactyl.io/), which focuses on game server management. 

The panel handles frontend interactions; this typically involves showing relevant information about a server, and sending commands to the containers.

### What is [Wings](https://github.com/pelican-dev/wings)?

**Wings** is a service worker that acts as a node, handling Docker containers created on Pelican behind-the-scenes.

Wings deals with the backend infrastructure such as managing, servicing, starting, restarting and stopping the container. The user never directly interacts with Wings.

### Open Source Software {#open-source}
Pelican is developed and released under [AGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html), an open source license; Wings is also open source, licensed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit)!
Contributions are welcome, and there are plenty of unresolved issues and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/pelican-dev).

### Glossary {#glossary}

**Pelican** / **Panel** is a web application built in Filament, which provides an interface for Wings containers, called "Servers" within the client.

**Wings** / **Node** is a service worker which handles the management of Docker containers by fulfilling the panel's requests.

**Server** / **Container** is a virtualized environment isolated within your network managed by Wings.

**Egg** is a file that provides default configurations when creating servers, utilising Yolks (or Docker Images).

**Docker** is an open platform that allows you to easily run Docker containers in an isolated network.

**Docker Image** is a file which contains libraries, dependencies, files, and more needed to run containers.

**Yolks** are a curated collection of Docker Images provided by Pelican which are intended to function with Eggs.
