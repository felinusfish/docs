# Easypanel

Pelican Panel is available as a pre-built Docker image through GitHub Packages. You can use either `ghcr.io/pelican-dev/panel:latest` for the latest stable release or `ghcr.io/pelican-dev/panel:main` which is automatically built from the main branch. This guide will walk you through deploying Pelican Panel using EasyPanel's custom service templates.

## Basic Setup with SQLite

For a basic setup using SQLite as the database, you can use the following service template:

```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "type": "app",
      "data": {
        "serviceName": "panel",
        "source": {
          "type": "image",
          "image": "ghcr.io/pelican-dev/panel:latest"
        },
        "env": "XDG_DATA_HOME: /pelican-data\nAPP_URL: \"https://$(EASYPANEL_DOMAIN)\"\nCADDY_URL: \"http://$(EASYPANEL_DOMAIN)\"",
        "domains": [
          {
            "host": "$(EASYPANEL_DOMAIN)",
            "port": 80
          }
        ],
        "mounts": [
          {
            "type": "volume",
            "name": "pelican-data",
            "mountPath": "/pelican-data"
          },
          {
            "type": "volume",
            "name": "pelican-logs",
            "mountPath": "/var/www/html/storage/logs"
          },
          {
            "type": "file",
            "content": "{\n    admin off\n    auto_https off\n}\n\n{$CADDY_URL} {\n    root * /var/www/html/public\n    encode gzip\n\n    php_fastcgi 127.0.0.1:9000\n    file_server\n}",
            "mountPath": "/etc/caddy/Caddyfile"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Advanced Setup with MariaDB and Redis

For a more advanced setup using MariaDB and Redis, use this template:

```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "type": "app",
      "data": {
        "serviceName": "panel",
        "source": {
          "type": "image",
          "image": "ghcr.io/pelican-dev/panel:latest"
        },
        "env": "XDG_DATA_HOME: /pelican-data\nAPP_URL: \"https://$(EASYPANEL_DOMAIN)\"\nCADDY_URL: \"http://$(EASYPANEL_DOMAIN)\"",
        "domains": [
          {
            "host": "$(EASYPANEL_DOMAIN)",
            "port": 80
          }
        ],
        "mounts": [
          {
            "type": "volume",
            "name": "pelican-data",
            "mountPath": "/pelican-data"
          },
          {
            "type": "volume",
            "name": "pelican-logs",
            "mountPath": "/var/www/html/storage/logs"
          },
          {
            "type": "file",
            "content": "{\n    admin off\n    auto_https off\n}\n\n{$CADDY_URL} {\n    root * /var/www/html/public\n    encode gzip\n\n    php_fastcgi 127.0.0.1:9000\n    file_server\n}",
            "mountPath": "/etc/caddy/Caddyfile"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "mariadb",
      "data": {
        "serviceName": "panel-db",
        "password": "51e2a4d6e98b7c57f9b6"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "redis",
      "data": {
        "serviceName": "panel-redis",
        "password": "69cbf211602afa32e194"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Installation Steps

1. In EasyPanel, create a new service using the `Create From Schema` option at the bottom of creating a new service
2. Paste either the basic or advanced template JSON
3. Click create to deploy panel

## Updating Domain Configuration

If you need to update your domain after initial deployment:

1. Update the domain in EasyPanel's domain settings
2. Update the environment variables in your service configuration:
    ```env
    APP_URL: "https://panel.example.com"
    CADDY_URL: "http://panel.example.com"
    ```
   Note: Keep `CADDY_URL` as `http://` since EasyPanel handles SSL certificates and reverse proxy
3. Redeploy the service to apply the changes

## Post-Installation

After deployment:

1. Access the installer at `https://panel.example.com/installer`
2. Complete the installation process
3. For the advanced setup, configure the following in the panel settings:
   - Database: Use the MariaDB credentials
   - Cache and Queue: Use the Redis credentials

:::note
The first time the container starts after installing or updating, it will apply database migrations, which may take a few minutes. The panel will not be accessible during this process.
